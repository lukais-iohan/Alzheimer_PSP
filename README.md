## Abstract

A comprehensive understanding of the pathological mechanisms involved at different
stages of neurodegenerative diseases is key for the advance of preventive and disease-
modifying treatments. Gene expression alterations in the diseased brain is a potential
source of information about biological processes affected by pathology. In this work, we
performed a systematic comparison of gene expression alterations in the brains of
human patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Progressive Supranuclear
Palsy (PSP) and animal models of amyloidopathy and tauopathy. Using system biology
approaches to uncover biological processes associated with gene expression
alterations, we could pinpoint processes more strongly associated with tauopathy/PSP
and amyloidopathy/AD. Notably, our data reveal that gene expression alterations
related to immune-inflammatory responses preponderate in younger, whereas those
associated to synaptic transmission are mainly observed in older AD patients. In PSP,
however, changes associated with immune-inflammatory responses and synaptic
transmission overlap. These two different patterns observed in AD and PSP brains are
fairly recapitulated in animal models of amyloidopathy and tauopathy, respectively.
Moreover, in AD, but not PSP or animal models, gene expression alterations related to
RNA splicing are highly prevalent, whereas those associated with myelination are
enriched both in AD and PSP, but not in animal models. Finally, we identify 12 AD and 4
PSP genetic risk factors in cell-type specific co-expression modules, thus contributing to
unveil the possible role of these genes to pathogenesis.
